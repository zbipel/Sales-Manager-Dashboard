## Business Request

The Sales Manager has requested the development of an interactive dashboard to monitor performance across three cities under his management. The primary objective is to gain insights into revenue trends over time, along with specific details such as:

- Identifying the busiest days and hours with the highest total transaction numbers.
- Analyzing the popularity of different product categories.
- Determining the contribution of each company branch to the total revenue.
- Additionally, the Sales Manager aims to assess customer satisfaction with the shopping experience, categorized by gender. The investigation extends to understanding customer preferences regarding payment methods and their participation in the loyalty program.
